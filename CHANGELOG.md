## 0.2.0

### Enhancements

* Added a script to pull the latest assets from UiKit's repo.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed `Mixed Content` errors by replacing `http://` with `https://`.

* Bonus, active state in nav started working again. We suspect it's has to due with serving the site from a subdomain rather than a subdirectory.

### Miscellaneous

* Moved demo site to subdomain.
