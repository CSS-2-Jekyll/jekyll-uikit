# jekyll-uikit

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes`, your sass files in `_sass` and any other assets in `assets`.

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem


## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-uikit"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-uikit
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-uikit

## Usage

#### TODO: Write usage instructions here.

* Describe your available layouts, includes, sass and/or assets.

* Flesh out Documentation and Installation instructions
